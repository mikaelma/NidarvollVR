# Adding entries
There are three ways of adding entries to the database.
## Using the template in this folder
The recommended way of entering data is to use the template provided in this folder. The workflow is described in the file. Once everything is filled out, simply run the code on the server.
The advantage of using this method is that the data is stored in the file for simple re-entry if that is needed. The other options do not store the data in other places than the database and all data will be lost if the entry is deleted from the database.
## Using the **insert** procedures
In MySQL Workbench, simply run the procedures in the sidebar and fill in the forms in the pop-up window.
## Manual entry
Writing manual insert queries in MySQL. This is complex if it is done for the whole building, but can be useful for entering categorical data etc.
